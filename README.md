# README
This is my personal weather web. 
The main design (HTML and CSS) got from this website (https://www.educative.io/answers/how-to-create-a-simple-weather-application-with-html-css-and-js)
The javascript code is mine.
The API I used are from different resources (PostMan, Ninja API, restcountries.com)
This weather **doesn't use database**. The data are simply retrieve from API call.
